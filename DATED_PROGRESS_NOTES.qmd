*December 16, 2023:*
- adding ns("...") inside of server inputs solved the issue of filtering out
previously-selected input options
- need to solve the problem of the conditional panels now not all being displayed
once the dataset is selected
- consider adding option(s) to view dataset details. e.g.-- `skimr::skim()` or
similar function

*December 17, 2023:*
- created 3 new modules: data, data_info, inputs. 
- what works: new modules
- what needs fixing: conditional panel logic. wanting a sequential display instead of all options appearing after selecting the dataset
